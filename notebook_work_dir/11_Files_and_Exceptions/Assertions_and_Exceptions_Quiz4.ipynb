    "Consider the function Normalize that takes as input a list of positive numbers numbers and returns a list of numbers that are a fraction of the maximum element in the list. Try to answer the questions without running the code. Check your answers, then run the code for the ones you get wrong. You'll learn the most this way, by figuring things out, instead of just running the code and reading off the answers.\n",
